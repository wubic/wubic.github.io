        <p><h1><a href='./post/2020-06-08-17-24.html'>CYBAR PARTY CTF 2020</a></h1></p>
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon an Open-Source Intelligence Capture-The-Flag competition arranged by CYBAR. It had been announced to be open for the entire world to compete against each other due to the ongoing pandemics travel restrictions. Since it was weekend and I have promised my self to not sit in front of the computer more then necessary, I first decided to just collect the challenges write-up and not compete. However, when the Saturday 6 of June came closer, I started to feel the hunger to compete. I decided to put a couple of hours between my girlfriends birthday party and a Sunday afternoon Frisbee golf event with some friends - what a perfect weekend. Hence, this is the write up of my first Open-Source Intelligence competition experience and results, let the battle begin!</p>

        <p>In my various roles, I have learned that security shall not be “yet another burden”. Instead it shall be designed around the well-known KISS-principle noted by the U.S Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather then made heavily complicated; therefore, simplicity is an important cornerstone in my security solutions and well connected to any business needs and way of work.</p>
