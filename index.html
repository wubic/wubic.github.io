        <p><h1><a href='./post/2020-06-08-17-24.html'>CYBAR PARTY CTF 2020</a></h1></p>
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon an Open-Source Intelligence Capture-The-Flag competition arranged by CYBAR. It had been announced to be open for the entire world to compete against each other due to the ongoing pandemics travel restrictions. Since it was weekend and I have promised my self to not sit in front of the computer more then necessary, I first decided to just collect the challenges write-up and not compete. However, when the Saturday 6 of June came closer, I started to feel the hunger to compete. I decided to put a couple of hours between my girlfriends birthday party and a Sunday afternoon Frisbee golf event with some friends - what a perfect weekend. Hence, this is the write up of my first Open-Source Intelligence competition experience and results, let the battle begin!</p>

        <p>My passion for technical challenges has given me a high level of technical understanding and I have meet many interesting individuals in the field of information security. I have also participated since the beginning of the yearly Red and Blue Team Cyber Defense training held by the Swedish Defense Research Agency due to my professional connections in critical infrastructure and particularly in the field of telecommunication.</p>
