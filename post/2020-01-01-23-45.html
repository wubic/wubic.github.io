        <h1>About Marcus Lundblad, a self biography</h1>
        <p>Dear visitor,</p>
        
        <p>I have had the great fortune to be involved with nearly every dimension of security at international level. For example, i have executed penetration test, developed exploit and security detection software, preventing fraud and Cyber incidents, completed compliance/agreement audits against ISO27001/ISF standard, deployed vulnerability management, endpoint protection, AI based network monitoring, IAM and PAM technologies, participated in implementing general data protection law, electronic communication law, protective security act, participated in building the next generation of secure mobile communication networks based on international community driven security standards, participated in different security forums and being trained by the Swedish Armed Forces, Swedish civil contingencies agency and the supervisory authorities.</p>
        
        <p>In my various roles, I have learned that security shall not be “yet another burden”. Instead it shall be designed around the well known KISS-principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather then made heavily complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in my design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.</p>
        
        <p>By identifying productivity and functionality issues that has been inherited from complex security processes or products, I have understood that departments could also be more optimized and cost-effective by designing simple, modern and effective security solutions based on way of work.</p>
        
        <p>My passion for technical challenges has given me a high level of technical understanding and I have meet many interesting individuals in the field of information security. I have also participated since the beginning of the yearly Red and Blue Team Cyber Defense training held by the Swedish Defense Research Agency due to my professional connections in critical infrastructure and particularly in the field of telecommunication.</p>
        
        <p>With those final words I hope to have presented my own background history and enlightened you a little bit about my career path. I hope to be able to talk to you soon and elaborate more around my passion for information security.</p>
        
        <p>Yours sincerely,
        Marcus Lundblad</p>
