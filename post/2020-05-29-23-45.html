        <h1>About Marcus Lundblad, a self biography</h1>
        <p>Dear visitor,</p>
        
        <p>In my various roles, I have learned that security shall not be “yet another burden”. Instead it shall be designed around the well-known KISS-principle noted by the U.S Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather then made heavily complicated; therefore, simplicity is an important cornerstone in my security solutions and well connected to any business needs and way of work.</p>
        
        <p>I have had the great fortune to be involved with nearly every dimension of cyber security at international level during my career as a cyber security specialist. Some examples follow:</p>
        
        <p>- Leading and executing penetration tests.<br>
        - Developed vulnerability management solutions and processes.<br>
        - Developed exploitation techniques and software.<br>
        - Preventing fraud and cyber incidents.<br>
        - Participated in agreement / outsourcing audits.<br>
        - Participated in implementing well known security standards<br>
        - Participated in implementing the data protection and communication laws.<br>
        - Participated in implementing the Protective Security Act.<br>
        - Participated in implementing the next generation of secure mobile communication.<br>
        - Participated in national security forums for critical infrastructure.<br>
        - Participated in international security projects.</p>
        
        <p>Trained by:</p>
        
        - Swedish armed forces in a yearly red and blue team exercise and total defense strategy.<br>
        - Swedish civil contingencies agency in network monitoring and investigations.<br>
        - Supervisory authorities in national threats and total defense strategy within specific fields.<br>
        - International security researchers in writing exploit software.</p>
        
        <p>I hope to have enlightened you a little bit about my career path and that we could speak soon.</p>
        
        <p>Yours sincerely,
        Marcus Lundblad</p>
