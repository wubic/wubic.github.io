        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon an Open-Source Intelligence Capture-The-Flag competition arranged by CYBAR. It had been announced to be open for the entire world to compete against each other due to the ongoing pandemics travel restrictions. Since it was weekend and I have promised my self to not sit in front of the computer more then necessary, I first decided to just collect the challenges write-up and not compete. However, when the Saturday 6 of June came closer, I started to feel the hunger to compete. I decided to put a couple of hours between my girlfriends birthday party and a Sunday afternoon Frisbee golf event with some friends - what a perfect weekend. Hence, this is the write up of my first Open-Source Intelligence competition experience and results, let the battle begin!</p>

        <p><h2>Tutorial Island</h2></p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Description: Welcome to the CYBAR Open-Source Intelligence CTF. Most challenges can be solved with a browser and some know-how - online tools might help too.
        
        When you find something, whether it be a picture, text, code or whatnot, you can submit it into the CTF server by putting the 'flag format' around it. For example, if the flag asked you to find the name of a yellow fruit, and yo confirmed it was a banana, you'd submit "CYBAR{banana}". Don't worry too much about caps, it's not case-sensitive.
        
        To kick it off, let's try your first flag. You get into work, boot up your system and hit Spotify up. You can't remember the name of the artist or song you were listening to the other day but it put you in the ZONE. Scratching your head, you remember just a line of lyrics...
        
        "In the name of the Spam God, that's what's up"
        
        Huh. Let's do a quick search and see if we can find the artist, and submit as a flag. When done, you can kick off their playlist to pair with the CTF.</p>
        
        <p><h2>Walkthrough</h2></p>
        
        <p>This challenge required us to put quotes around the lyric text and ask Google Search to help us out identify the artist.</p>
        
        <img src="media/cybar-ctf-2020/tutorial-island.png" />
        
        <p>The flag was <b>CYBAR{YTCracker}</b></p>
        
        <p><h2>Trojan Horse</h2></p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Description: It's 12:57am. You get an SMS from your red team manager - "Hey, we have a situation... Call me.".
        
        Stepping out of bed and into the sleepy lights of the city, you tighten your hoodie and hit call. - "Hey. So a crime-stoppers report just came in, and apparently a passerby spotted a roomba trying to implant a consciousness into a... yeah this is going to sound weird... horse. Said something like 'the horse had a name on its side', but couldn't remember what. He said it was no more than 200m past the BP Petrol station in Mansfield, VIC on his way to Mt Buller. Located on the side of the road. Find the horse, find what name was on its coat. Once you've done that, we can put out an All-Points Bulletin for it."
        
        Find and submit the name on the horses' coat to notify local law enforcement in the area.</p>
        
        <p><h2>Walkthrough</h2></p>
        
        <p>This challenge required us to use Google Maps together with the Street View functionality to find a horse around 200 meter away from a BP Petrol station in Mansfield, Victoria on the road to Mt buller.</p>
        
        <img src="media/cybar-ctf-2020/trojan-horse.gif" />
        
        <p>The flag was <b>CYBAR{SWAGS}</b></p>
        
        <p><h2>Static on the Wire</h2></p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Roombas everywhere are using social media to try and spread COVID propaganda about 5G infecting the public...basically saying people will start emitting Wi-Fi radiation.
        
        However, a new tactic has just hit our radar. We've just received reports of propaganda spreading through amateur radio. We're unsure of the call-sign, but the caller reported the following statement:
        
        "I was on the phone to my wife in Florence, Alabama. In the background of her HAM radio, I heard someone calling himself 'Scotty' in some weird-ass robotic voice, clamoring on about that 'demic giving everyone 5G and sorts."
        
        That's all we have to go off for now. Find the call-sign and submit it to us so we can start tracking down their home address.
        
        Flag format: CYBAR{x}</p>
        
        <p><h2>Walkthrough</h2></p>
        
        <p>This challenge required us to find a database that we could use to search for a person matching our description. The national association for amateur radio have a very useful FCC license data search function. I had to gusse that "Scotty" was a nickname for Scott.</p>
        
        <img src="media/cybar-ctf-2020/static-on-the-wire.gif" />
        
        <p>The flag was <b>CYBAR{KG4RFV}</b></p>
        
        <p><h2>Where in the world is Wuhan - Part 1</h2></p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Description: Subject: Possible compromise - Facebook superadmin account Message: We've received an alert from CERT Australia of a possible superadmin compromise within Facebook's backend servers. As you know, they control a number of global node servers and if the roombas get access to pushing content....who knows what they might do. But we're currently looking at Roombas trying to learn the genetic structure and makeup of the novel coronavirus...from various supercookies tracking scientists browser history research. Of course, this can all be found out via the GraphQL API.
        
        Facebook being facebook, they're not providing any word at this point. However, combining this with the thousands of Federal Police ACORNS reports we've had in the past few days, it's possible. Let's start from the top. Find Mark Zuckerbergs email address and submit it into the portal; we'll run some automated checks to see if it's appeared in any 3rd party breach sites.</p>
        
        <p><h2>Walkthrough</h2></p>
        
        <p>This challenge required us to find a way to verify Mark Zuckerbergs email address. I first used Google Search to find databases or articles that could give away his potential email addresses. I then jumped to facebook and tried to see if that service could give me some sort of hint. To my surprise i hit an error message telling me that the password reset functionality was turned off. I have never seen this behaviour before and must be a clue that the account must have some sort of personal connection to facebook.</p>
        
        <img src="media/cybar-ctf-2020/zuck-fb.gif" />
        
        <p>The flag was <b>CYBAR{zuck@fb.com}</b></p>
        
        <p><h2>You've heard of elf on the shelf, but what about the proliferation of COVID-19?</h2></p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Description: The Roombas are trying to gain the upper hand over the human population. We believe they're going to target pivotal industries such as real estate, critical infrastructure, information security and healthcare. We don't know who yet, but we know it's a group of close friends and all are infected with COVID-19.
        
        We need to enact Contact Tracing - finding every detail about their lives in order to predict and contain their movements. No one has heard from them since March. We must build up details about them for the agents to then take over. That's where you come in.
        
        Our first piece of intelligence is a gentleman by the name of Marc Hevis - a co-owner of Hevis Properties Pty Ltd. We have agents ready on the ground, and others covering all his other social media - your task is to find his Twitter account.
        
        Flag format: CYBAR{x} (No @ sign)</p>
        
        <p><h2>Walkthrough</h2></p>
        
        <p>This challenge was also very straight forward by using Google Search with Marc Hervis name in quotes.</p>
        
        <img src="media/cybar-ctf-2020/marc-hevis.PNG" />
        
        <p>The flag was <b>CYBAR{HevisMarc}</b></p>
        
        <p><h2>By A Thread - Part 1</h2></p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Description: Images in the background can reveal details such as email accounts. Those could be logged into to find sensitive information. This can be used to social engineer or extract secrets from unknowing accomplices.
        
        Challenge text: Alright, we need to start building up a profile of Marc's friend, Alycee. Find anything you can that might help us find more information on government databases about her such as an Australian Business Number (ABN).
        
        We managed to locate her tax agent on AirTasker - maybe you could get in touch and somehow convince him to provide some information about her tax return.
        
        https://www.airtasker.com/users/paul-n-19685038/
        
        Public records show his email address is taxteamtechs@gmail.com
        
        Flag format: CYBAR{x x x}</p>
        
        <p><h2>Walkthrough</h2></p>
        
        <p>This challenge required us to get in touch with Paul. I tried to see what would happen if you just send an email to the identified address and just ask about the information.</p>
        
        <img src="media/cybar-ctf-2020/by-a-thread-part-1.gif" />

        <p><h2>By A Thread - Part 2</h2></p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Description: Can you locate Alycee's date of birth?
        
        Flag format: CYBAR{xx/xx/xxxx}</p>
        
        <p><h2>Walkthrough</h2></p>
        
        <p>This challenge required us to get in touch with Paul again. However this time we need to find the email and password combination before we send an email to Paul.</p>
        
        <img src="media/cybar-ctf-2020/by-a-thread-part-2.gif" />

        <p><h2>Contact Tracing - Part 1</h2></p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Description: It's suspected the Roomba targeted one of Marc's friends, Alycee, with COVID19 based on her regular flights around the world to different critical infrastructure areas (e.g. gas and oil). We must undertake contact tracing for Alycee without warning the subject. We need to find out every location she has been in the past few years to get a profile. This profile will then help us predict and prevent where she might go next.
        
        What is the full URL of Alycee's art account?
        
        Flag format: CYBAR{https://www.x.x/x}</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;">Description: We've learned that Pong has a vehicle and may have visited nearby towns in the past few months.
